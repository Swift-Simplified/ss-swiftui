# How To: 👈
# Display A SwiftUI View 
in a Swift playground 🛝

[Download](https://github.com/Swift-Simplified/ss-swiftui/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this Swift playground file to run the example given in [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode).

## This Playground Teaches 👨🏻‍🏫
How to create and display a SwiftUI view inside a Swift playground. 

Swift playgrounds now support displaying both a UIKit and a SwiftUI view *(both are different UI frameworks)* within a Swift playground. The support isn't advanced or in-depth however it will be enough to try something out or maybe just to add a visual layer to your code.

The code to display a SwiftUI `View` will look something like this:

```Swift
// MARK: - 📦 Sourcecode
import SwiftUI // import all the UI code
import PlaygroundSupport // import the ability to use a live view

class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    let title: String
    init(title: String) {
        self.title = title
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    
    @StateObject var viewModel: ViewModel
    
    var body: some View {
        Text(viewModel.title)
    }
}

// MARK: - ⚡️ Execution Area
let viewModel = ViewModel(title: "Learn Swift")
let contentView = ContentView(viewModel: viewModel)
PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(contentView)
// << 🔵 Run Point
```

## How To Download ⬇️
You can download this Swift playground by clicking the `Code` button at the top of this page. 

## How To Run The Playground 🏃🏾‍♂️
This repo stores a Swift playground file which are run and executed within [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) *(the tool used by developers to build apps)* and you simply need to double click the file.

## Why Learn In A Swift Playground 🛝
Swift playgrounds allow for rapid developmemt and provide a very fast and fluid thought-to-code process. There is no time taken to compile, build or install an app to an iOS simulator. Instead, the compilation time is fast and results are viewed almost immediately. 

The term "playground" is a very fitting name for both the feature and the file extension itself. It may be safe to assume that this feature was designed for "playing around"... or "learning" as we like to call it. 😆

## How To Become A Swift Engineer
Most companies that offer iOS developer jobs simply need to maintain an existing Swift system that has previoiusly been put in place. Creating the architecture and thinking about performance can be difficult and may require some expert knowledge, but they are not the needs of most companies. In fact, if you are interested in maintaining an existing system then the technology industry will be a huge market place in which to advertise your skills. 

With the interest of both parties in mind *(the business and the employee)* having great Swift knowledge and being able to write safe code will be the biggest focus - *which is great news!* 😃🥳🎉 

This means, all you need to do is 👉 **[learn Swift!](https://www.swiftsimplified.com/the-swift-handbook)** 👈

## Why Learn Swift
To become an iOS developer with a great salary who can work anywhere in the world using only a laptop and an internet connection. 

By studying the language all of the other pieces of the puzzle will fall into place. With a clear grasp of the Swift programming language it will be much easier to apply for jobs and to pass each test they provide. The rest will be provided to you as you learn whats required within that role for that specific company. 

**Step 1**: Learn Swift

**Step 2**: Get A Job  - *learn how to make apps*

**Step 3**: 🕺🏼💃🪩

## Support The Worlds no.1 Company 
Wouldn't it make sense to write software for the worlds no.1 most prifitable company? I mean.. if you want to gain a good career and live a wealthy lifestyle. 🤷🏼‍♂️

We are tyring to consolidate more than a decades commercial experience combined with the official Swift documentation into short online courses *(created for fast learning)*, so that our students can live happier and wealthier lives - simply by learning 1 language! 😎

Why not think about becoming an iOS developer making apps for Apple software. 🤔💭
