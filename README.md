## This Playground Teaches 👨🏻‍🏫
How to create and display a SwiftUI view inside a Swift playground. 

Swift playgrounds now support displaying both a UIKit and a SwiftUI view *(both are different UI frameworks)* within a Swift playground. The support isn't advanced or in-depth however it will be enough to try something out or maybe just to add a visual layer to your code.

## How To Download ⬇️
You can download this Swift playground by clicking the `Code` button at the top of this page. 

## How To Run 🏃🏾‍♂️
Swift playground files run within [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) *(the tool used by developers to build apps)* and you simply need to double click the file.

## Why Learn In A Playground 🛝
Swift playgrounds allow for rapid developmemt and provide a very fast and fluid thought-to-code process. There is no time taken to compile, build or install an app to an iOS simulator. Instead, the compilation time is fast and results are viewed almost immediately. 

The term "playground" is a very fitting name for both the feature and the file extension itself. It may be safe to assume that this feature was designed for "playing around"... or "learning" as we like to call it. 😆
